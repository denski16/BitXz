            <h1>Night Crows</h1>
            <p>
                The game features 4 classes with 8 sub classes and 3 class advancement stages. The game intends to have huge PvP wars where three servers take part in a RvRvR battle with 
                more than a thousand players, all of which will be able to battle for control of the land and air, as players will be able to take to the sky using gliders. As you can 
                expect with a name like Night Crows, gliders play a very important part in the gameplay, and are meant as both a fun way to traverse the world as well as a strategic battle option. 
                As with other ‘popular’ Wemade Global games like MIR4 players will contend with a Web3 Blockchain Economy, where they will earn in-game rewards and cultivate characters, and then 
                have the option to mint those characters as NFT’s which they can then sell online to other players. Wemade has spent significant time “perfecting” their tokenomics, which has 
                translated itself into 7 different tokens in Night Crows, solidifying the overtly complex and confusing nature of the system as a whole. The system runs on the backing of the 
                WEMIX GameFi platform, which connects to multiple games and markets, where the currency can potentially be utilized across multiple games in some capacity, or sold for real money.

            <p>
                The game-changing possibilities that blockchain spurs through immutability, tokenization and decentralization are immense. The technology has significantly expanded the scope of traditional trading and collectible card games by democratizing the ideals of ownership, scarcity, interoperability, transparency and play-to-earn (P2E). The excitement factor of trading card games (TCG) — previously confined to school lunch tables and enthusiast get-togethers — has now truly gone global, thanks to blockchain gaming. Gods Unchained embodies the future of trading card gameplay. It taps into the rich world of marvelous mythical gods and their strengths and weaknesses, represented by over 1,500 unique cards.

            <h1>Decentraland</h1>
            <p>
                There are many different ways to define Decentraland. Most definitions state that it is a virtual, augmented, or extended reality social experience or game. Realistically, and as of its state at the end of 2023, it is a three-dimensional online platform allowing users to be part of a shared digital experience where they can play games, socialize, and create, buy, or sell digital items. You can buy a plot of virtual land and create anything you want on it. If you have virtual or augmented reality goggles, you can wear them while in Decentraland or load the program on the screen of one of your devices and play it like a game. Users can create unique environments, marketplaces, and applications by spending Decentraland’s native token, MANA. MANA is an ERC-20 fungible token that serves as Decentrand’s digital currency. It is spent (burned) when it is used to purchase anything in Decentraland. MANA is also spent to create centralized games, apps, and other services. The blockchain allows creators to monetize their creations in that it allows them to digitally construct whatever they can think of and charge other users to look at, use, or interact with it. The blockchain includes two non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens, LAND and Estate. Land is a 52-foot x 52-foot (16 meter x 16 meter) plot of digital real estate (scaled to the digital environment), and an Estate is two or more adjacent plots. Creators and users can schedule and host community events, including concerts, movie screenings, casino nights, avatar dances, or anything else they can think of. Other options are to buy or sell digital art and land. Clusters of land parcels have different characteristics. Decentraland’s squares include Vegas City, District X (the red-light district), Fashion Street, Dragon City, and other themed areas.

            <h1>Alien Worlds</h1>
            <p>
                The basic Alien Worlds gameplay has two primary layers. The first consists of mining on plots of land with your Shovel or other mining-related NFTs. In return, miners receive a small amount of Trilium tokens (TLM). At the same time, players gain Shards, an in-game currency which can be used to purchase a rotating selection of NFTs. Each plot of land in Alien Worlds is owned by a player. The owning player receives a percentage of the Trilium mined on their land. The second layer consists of Syndicates, player-run, planetary governments that submit and vote on proposals for the Alien Worlds ecosystem using Trilium tokens allotted to their planet. Alien Worlds features a number of NFTs including Land Plots, Tools, Minions, Avatars, and Weapons. All game NFTs live on the WAX blockchain.

            <p>
                The Sandbox is a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences in the Ethereum blockchain. The Sandbox is best known for its two smash mobile hits The Sandbox (2011) and The Sandbox Evolution (2016), which combined generated 40 million downloads across iOS and Android. In 2018, developer/Publisher Pixowl decided to bring this successful User Generated Content gaming IP and large community of creators from mobile to the blockchain ecosystem. The goal: disrupt existing game makers like Minecraft and Roblox by providing creators with true ownership of their creations as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and reward them for their participation in the ecosystem. The Sandbox blockchain gaming platform consists of three integrated products that together provide a comprehensive experience for user-generated content (UGC) production. The combined products further benefit users by allowing them to secure copyright ownership for their user-created content through blockchain and smart contracts.

            <h1>Splinterlands</h1>
            <p>
                Discover the exciting world of Splinterlands, a P2E collectible card game featuring unique NFTs, strategic battles and player-driven markets. Splinterlands is an innovative digital trading card game that provides players with full ownership over their in-game assets. Utilizing Web 3.0 technology powered by the Hive blockchain, every card in Splinterlands is a unique nonfungible token that is owned by a player. Hive is a decentralized, community-driven blockchain that was forked from the Steem blockchain. In Splinterlands, each card (e.g. Summoners and Monsters) in a player's collection has its own stats and abilities and can use their cards in different ways. For instance, they can use cards to battle and win rewards, keep them as collectibles, trade them with other players on a marketplace, combine them to make them stronger, or even burn them to get Dark Energy Crystals (DEC), which is the official in-game currency of Splinterlands. In the future, cards will be able to be staked on land plots in order to farm additional NFTs, totems, and other benefits that will help players attain victory on the battlefield. Splinterlands was built by its founders to provide a unique gaming experience that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology. The team behind Splinterlands believed that traditional games often lack transparency, fairness, and ownership, which can lead to a frustrating and unsatisfying gaming experience. By building Splinterlands on the Hive blockchain, the founders were able to create a game that addresses these issues and provides openness and fairness in gameplay, removing the potential for fraud or cheating. Furthermore, the ability to earn cryptocurrency while playing adds an extra layer of excitement and motivation to the game, providing players with real-world rewards for their efforts.

            <h1>Spells of Genesis</h1>
            <p>
                Spells of Genesis (SoG) stands as the pioneer blockchain mobile game, fusing Trading Card Game (TCG) elements with arcade-style point-and-shoot mechanics. Spells of Genesis brings together card game strategy with the dynamic point-and-shoot excitement of arcade gaming, making it a groundbreaking blockchain-based mobile game. In this realm, players must strategically collect and combine cards to construct powerful decks, essential for victory against adversaries. This fusion of Trading Card Game (TCG) mechanics and arcade-style action forms the core of Spells of Genesis' gameplay. Moreover, as you journey through the captivating fantasy realm of Askian, collecting and trading orbs to assemble formidable teams, the blockchain collectibles in your wallet or acquired in-game take on vital roles. The power of a player's deck, their team, lies in the unique attributes and spells of their cards. Spells, in particular, wield immense power, dealing more damage and introducing special abilities that influence both allies and enemies. These arcane incantations can mend wounds and cast protective wards while amplifying the damage inflicted on foes. To unleash a spell, precise shots are essential. Spells of Genesis offers three distinct game modes: campaigns, raid, and challenge. Campaigns are a PvE adventure where players confront enemies, unlock new campaigns, and progress through over 700 levels across 30 campaigns. Raid mode ushers in PvP competition, matching players with similar ranks in battles that yield rewards in gold and PvP rank experience for the victor. However, the challenge mode centers on survival, testing players' endurance against increasingly formidable waves of enemies, with rewards growing in value as they persevere.

            <p>
                Star Atlas taps into the buzz around Metaverse technology and play-to-earn gaming, offering a peer-to-peer in-game economy, with land, assets, and other items represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This in-game economy centers around the Serum decentralized exchange built upon the Solana network. Serum allows players to buy and sell their in-game assets directly between each other, without the involvement of an intermediary company taking custody of these assets. Star Atlas players’ goal is to expand their space empire by acquiring land, mining the land for resources, and exploring the galaxy in search of ancient artifacts. On these adventures, players may encounter other players, as well as the lost ships, weapons and crews of deceased players who may have tried and failed to discover these treasures. As in-game items and rewards have real world value beyond the Star Atlas galaxy, players are incentivized to collect these items and capitalize on their achievements. New players can first get comfortable with the gameplay and explore the galaxy in the Faction Security Zone, while learning the basic battle functions and weapons. Once players feel ready, they can venture out to the Medium Security Zone, engaging in combat with other players and returning with NFT bounties to sell or trade.

From planting seeds and watering crops to fertilizing and harvesting, farming in Pixels offers a rewarding and immersive experience. And with the introduction of energy constraints, players must manage their actions wisely to maximize their productivity.
